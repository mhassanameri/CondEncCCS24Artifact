For running the test cases, you can follow this general command (assuming you are in build directory):



$ cd test
$ ./tests <option1>

The options are as follows.

1. ArtifactCCS24BasicTests
2. ArtifactCCS24
3. Table1

However before that, the required input .txt files need to be generated. The following we will describe how to do that.



============================================================

For running Basic Test (assuming you are in CondEncCPP/build) directory:
Do the following steps:
$ cd test
$ echo -e "HamDistT\n25\n1024\n32\n2" > BasicTestInputs.txt
# This command generates an input txt file ``BasicTestInputs.txt'' which indicates:
#   HamDistT: The target predicate, other options: EDOne, CAPSLOCK, OR, all. Note that all will run test for all predicates.
#   Num_Of_rounds: 25  (runs the CondEnc for Hamming distance for 25 different message m_1 and its corresponding typos)
#   pk size= 1024,
#   _len =  32 (other options are 8, 16, 64, 128)
#   T = 2 (other options are 1, 2, 3, 4)
# Note that \n just goes to the next line of BasicTestInputs.txt and makes sure that the new input argument will be added in the next line.

$ ./tests ArtifactCCS24BasicTests
# the Test_Case compiled file ./tests


For The Performance Evaluation Do the following steps (To generate the .dat file required to plot Figure 1 of our paper):

$cd test
$rm *.dat
$ echo  -e "PlotFig1a1b1c\n10\n2\n1" > input.txt  # Indicating the target figure to plot the options: [PlotFig1a1b1c, PlotFig1a1b1cNo128, PlotFig1d, PlotFig1e, PlotFig1f]

# This command will generate input.txt file which is required for test case that generates the .dat files required for obtaining Figure 1 in paper.
# PlotFig1a1b1c: The target figure: it generates the .dat files required to plot Figure 1a, 1b and 1c
# Note that \n just goes to the next line of BasicTestInputs.txt and makes sure that the new input argument will be added in the next line.
# 10:  Number of tests for messages of length _len = 8, 16, 32
# 2:  Number of tests for messages of length _len =64
# 1:  Number of tests for messages of length _len =128. You can set this value =0  to avoid running tests related to _len=128 as it needs more time to be executed.

$ ./tests ArtifactCCS24
[Optional: to visualize the results and reproduce figures of Figure 1 of the paper. For example Figure 1a, Figure 1b and Figure 1c]
$ python3 ./PlotFigure.py Figure1a
$ python3 ./PlotFigure.py Figure1b
$ python3 ./PlotFigure.py Figure1c


For Obtaining the required data for reproducing Table 1

```
$ cd test
$ echo -e "100" > Table1_input.txt
$ ./tests Table1
$ python3 ./PdfGenTable1.py     #[Optional: Generates Table1.pdf file]

```

Alternatively you can also do
```
./TestScriptMakingTable1data.sh
python3 ./PdfGenTable1.py

```
