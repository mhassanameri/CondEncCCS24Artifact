TypTop: Personalized Typo-tolerant Password Checker
----------------------------------------------------------------

Hello!

Typtop observes for password typing mistakes, and enable
logging in with slight variations of your actual login
password that are frequent and safe. This software attaches
a new pluggable authentication module (PAM) to all of your
common authentication processes, such as su, login,
lock-screen etc.


Thanks for installing TypToP.  This is a research prototype,
and we are collecting some anonymous non-sensitive data
about your password typing patterns to verify our
design. The details of the data we collect and the security
blueprint of this software can be found in the website
https://typtop.info.

The participation in the study is completely voluntary. You
can opt out at any time while still keep using the software.

Checkout the utility script `typtop` for configuration
options (such as how to opt out of the study) by typing
'typtop' in the terminal.
